"Found this cool pep talk generator on Reddit. Good activity to try with students learning arrays. Randomise choice from 4 such arrays and display a cool message each time! #edtech #edchat #Python https://pic.twitter.com/BpUUj246gt"


I turned into a great little program for 6th graders practicing list, data types, objects, while loops, and conditional statements.
